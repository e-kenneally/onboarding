The file with the bulk of my work is called main.py, and it contains:
      1. Voxelwise time series data -> voxelwise connectomes
      2. Voxelwise time series data -> parcellated time series data with 2 atlases
      3. Voxelwise time series data -> parcellated connectomes with 2 atlases
      4. WB command used to generate parcellated time series data on the surface

Other files include:
  - modified_pipeline.py: Modified version of pipeline
  - diff_output.py: Difference between output from CPAC using default pipeline vs modified pipeline
  - TODO: Output from running Mindboggle on same data
  - TODO: func_preproc_modified.py: file with modifications to include prior probability maps with FSL Fast
  - TODO: timeseries_analysis_modified.py: file with modifications to include the ability to run ciftify's mean 
    time series extraction tool
    
 CPAC default pipeline output file: 
  sub-0025429_ses-1_task-rest_run-1_space-template_desc-preproc-1_bold.nii 
 CPAC modified pipeline output file: (left it zipped to differentiate)
  sub-0025429_ses-1_task-rest_run-1_space-template_desc-preproc-1_bold.nii.gz 

Parts not completed:

One part of the document I didn't complete was the visualization of the brain parcellations on 
the surface. I was having strange errors regarding the display when I tried to run any visualization
tools, so I will reach out to IT to have that looked at. 

I also have not provided any output files from CPAC runs, since for some reason the files were too 
big to push to github. That is why I included the diff output file. 

I am still finishing up the expanding CPAC parts, so those files are not yet available.
